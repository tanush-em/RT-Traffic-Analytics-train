# RT-Traffic-Analytics

RT-Traffic-Analytics is a real-time traffic analysis tool that utilizes a YOLOv8 model for object detection and the DeepSORT algorithm for object tracking. 
This project is designed to analyze video footage and count unique vehicles, categorized into different classes such as cars, buses, two-wheelers, heavy vehicles, and auto-rickshaws.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Uses a YOLOv8 model trained on a custom dataset for detecting different classes of vehicles.
- **Object Tracking**: Integrates the DeepSORT tracking algorithm to uniquely identify and count vehicles across video frames.
- **Output Video with Annotations**: Generates an output video with bounding boxes and labels for detected and tracked objects.
- **Object Counting**: Maintains a count of unique objects detected throughout the video.
- **Output Statistics**: Saves the object counts in a separate file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.12
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- deep-sort-realtime (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)
